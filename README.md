## This is a repository for one dimensional finite element method

oned_fem.py is a python module containing the main functions:
* oned_mesh
* oned_gauss
* oned_shape
* oned_linear
* oned_bilinear

oned_fem_example.ipynb   is an ipython notebook containing the above functions and a detailed guideline on how to use them to solve a given Dirichlet boundary value problem. oned_fem_example.html is the html version of the   oned_fem_example.ipynb.  To view all contents in the two files, ensure that:

* nodes_and_elements1.png
* nodes_and_elements2.png
* quadratic_elements1.png

are in the same directory as  oned_fem_example.ipynb  or  oned_fem_example.html.

The modules oned_fem.py and oned_fem_example.py contain all codes necessary for solving a specific problem. Other things in the repo have to do with understanding the functions therein and how they work.
